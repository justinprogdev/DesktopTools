## Desktop tools is essentially a playground for WinForms expirimentation. I have more to add later, as I clean my local source.

### WinLogger and WinMonitor were an idea I had to have a monitor window open that would show logs from any app on your desktop with pipeline streams. 

The idea is that winlogger could be added as a library to any .net project, and would write real time logs to a monitor.
Or you could log with different scripting/shells (see PowerShell-IntTest.txt example for PS). 
Then, you could monitor multiple apps' logs real time in one window.
However, I didn't put much effort into it, and it thread-locks. ðŸ”’
